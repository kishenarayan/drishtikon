Welcome to drishtikon (*perspective*). Stay a while! Drishtikon is a minimal [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme that takes inspiration from Andrew Hwan Park's [Brutalist Blog](https://hw4n.com/brutalist-blog/) and Tyler McRobert's [Bridget](https://tylermcrobert.com/bridget-baker). Additionally, this theme uses the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) typeface originally developed by Rasmus Andersson.

[Here](https://kishenarayan.github.io) is a link to my personal website which uses the same theme.
